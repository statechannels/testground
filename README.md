Testground is a platform for testing, benchmarking, and simulating distributed and p2p
systems at scale. It's designed to be multi-lingual and runtime-agnostic, scaling gracefully
from 2 to 10k instances, only when needed.

## Getting started

_NOTE: currently, we don't distribute binaries, so you will have to build from source._

***Prerequisites: Go 1.18+, Docker daemon running.***

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/testground/testground.git

$ cd testground

$ make install       # builds testground and the Docker image, used by the local:docker runner.

$ testground daemon  # will start the daemon listening on localhost:8042 by default.

# => open a different console (client-side), in the same directory (testground/testground repo checkout)

# import the network test plan from this repo into $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans
# read more about this path at https://docs.testground.ai/getting-started#running-testground
$ testground plan import --from ./plans/network

# run two instances of the `ping-pong` test case from the `network` plan,
# building with docker:go, running with local:docker
$ testground run single --plan=network --testcase=ping-pong \
                        --builder=docker:go --runner=local:docker \
                        --instances=2
```

## Documentation

This README is just the tip of the iceberg! **Check out our full documentation site at [docs.testground.ai](https://docs.testground.ai).**

There you will find a conceptual system walkthrough, tips on writing test plans, instructions on running test plans, configuring runners and builders, deploying Kubernetes clusters, and a lot more.

Please report any problems or inaccuracies by [opening a docs issue on this repo](https://github.com/testground/testground/issues/new?assignees=&labels=docs&template=DOCS.md&title=docs%20site:%20%3Cdescribe%20the%20problem%3E).

## How does it work?

1. **You develop distributed test plans as if you were writing unit tests against local APIs.**
    - No puppeteering necessary.
    - No need to package and ship the system or component under test as a separate daemon.
    - No need to expose every internal setting over an external API, just for the sake of testing.
    
2. **Your test plan calls out to the coordination API to:**
    - communicate out-of-band information (such as endpoint addresses, peer ids, etc.)
    - leverage synchronization and ordering primitives such as signals and barriers to model a
       distributed state machine.
    - programmatically apply network traffic shaping policies, which you can alter during the
       execution of a test to simulate various network conditions.
       
3. **There is no special "conductor" node telling instances what to do when.** The choreography and
   sequencing emerges from within the test plan itself.
   
4. **You decide what versions of the upstream software you want to exercise your test against.**
     - Benchmark, simulate, experiment, run attacks, etc. against versions v1.1 and v1.2 of the
       components under test in order to compare results, or test compatibility.
     - Assemble hybrid test runs mixing various versions of the dependency graph.
     
5. **Inside your test plan:**
     - You record observations, metrics, success/failure statuses.
     - You emit structured or unstructured assets you want collected, such as event logs,
       dumps, snapshots, binary files, etc.
        
6. **Via a TOML-based _composition_ file, you instruct Testground to:**
     - Assemble a test run comprising groups of 2, 200, or 10000 instances, each with different
       test parameters, or built against different depencency sets.
     - Schedule them for run locally (executable or Docker), or in a cluster (Kubernetes).
     
7. **You collect the outputs of the test plan with a single command,** and use data processing scripts and
   platforms (such as the upcoming Jupyter notebooks integration) to draw conclusions.

## Features

### Supports (or aims to support) a variety of testing workflows üí°

> (üåï = fully supported // üåë = planned)

  * Experimental/iterative development üåñ (The team at Protocol Labs has used Testground extensively to evaluate
    protocol changes in large networks, simulate attacks, measure algorithmic improvements across network boundaries,
    etc.) 
  * Debugging üåó
  * Comparative testing üåñ
  * Backwards/forward-compatibility testing üåñ 
  * Interoperability testing üåë
  * Continuous integration üåë
  * Stakeholder/acceptance testing üåë

### Simple, normalized, formal runtime environment for tests üìÑ

A test plan is a blackbox with a formal contract. Testground promises to inject a set of env variables, and the test
plan promises to emit events on stdout, and assets on the output directory.
  * As such, a test plan can be any kind of program, written in Go, JavaScript, C, or shell.
  * At present, we offer builders for Go, with TypeScript (node and browser) being in the works.  

### Modular builders and runners üõ†

For running test plans written in different languages, targeted for different runtimes, and levels of scale:
  * `exec:go` and `docker:go` builders: compile test plans written in Go into executables or containers.
  * `local:exec`, `local:docker`, `cluster:k8s` runners: run executables or containers locally
    (suitable for 2-300 instances), or in a Kubernetes cloud environment (300-10k instances).

> Got some spare cycles and would like to add support for writing test plans Rust, Python or X? It's easy! Open an
> issue, and the community will guide you!

### Distributed coordination API üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Redis-backed lightweight API offering synchronisation primitives to coordinate and choreograph distributed test
workloads across a fleet of nodes.

### Network traffic shaping ‚òéÔ∏è

Test instances are able to set connectedness, latency, jitter, bandwidth, duplication, packet corruption, etc. to
simulate a variety of network conditions.

### Quickstart k8s cluster setup on AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è

Create a k8s cluster ready to run Testground jobs on AWS by following the instructions at
[`testground/infra`](https://github.com/testground/infra).

### Upstream dependency selection üß©

Compiling test plans against specific versions of upstream dependencies (e.g. moduleX v0.3, or commit 1a2b3c).

### Dealing with upstream API changes üå±

So that a single test plan can work with a range of versions of the components under test, as these evolve over time.

### Results and diagnostics, raw and aggregated data points üìà

**Diagnostics:** Automatic diagnostics via pprof (for Go test plans), with metrics emitted to InfluxDB in real-time. Metrics can be raw data points or aggregated measurements, such as histograms, counters, gauges, moving averages, etc.

**Results:** When the test plan concludes, all results are pushed in batch to InfluxDB for later exploration, analysis, and visualization.

### Declarative jobs, we call them _compositions_ üéº

Create tailored test runs by composing scenarios declaratively, with different groups, cohorts, upstream deps, test
params, etc. 

### Emit and collect test outputs üíæ

Emit and collect/export/download test outputs (logs, assets, event trails, run events, etc.) from all participants
in a run. 

## Where to find test plans?

There are some basic, project-agnostic Testground test plans in the [`plans`](./plans) directory.
We use these plans to validate the functionality of Testground itself.

To link them under `$TESTGROUND_HOME/plans`, if you're using default paths, these commands should do the trick
(assuming you have already run the Testground daemon once, and therefore the `$TESTGROUND_HOME` layout has been created
for you):

```shell script
$ # from the root of this repo, run the following; it will symlink all test plans under $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans
$ ln -s $PWD/plans/* $HOME/testground/plans
$ testground run single --plan network --testcase ping-pong --builder=docker:go --runner=local:docker --instances=2
```

For project-specific test plans, check out these repos:

* https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans
* https://github.com/ipfs/test-plans

To use them, import them into `$TESTGROUND_HOME/plans` using the following testground commands:

```shell script
$ testground plan import --git --from https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans.git --name libp2p
$ testground plan import --git --from https://github.com/ipfs/test-plans.git --name ipfs
$ # to run the find-peers test case from the libp2p/dht test plan (this is not a complete command!)
$ testground run single --plan libp2p/dht --testcase find-peers --builder docker:go --runner local:docker <options>
```
